Stranginator Name Generator 0.0.2
Created by moldbun

*****************

Welcome to the Stranginator Name Generator. This program has the simple objective of
taking in a name, and making it strange.

As the program is currently in alpha, bugs are highly likely. While there are
currently thousands of possible combinations for unique names, the generator
only has minimal combinations at this time. As further iterations are developed,
names will truly become random and unique.

***INSTRUCTIONS***
-Open the .bat file to run the program.

0.0.1 - Changelog
-Implemented functionality to take in user input and modify the original input to a goofy name.
-Implemented functionality to add a strange last name to the user's input.
-Implemented functionality that has a 50% chance of adding a 'title' to the end of user input.

0.0.2 - Changelog
-Removed ArrayList values being manually added through program code
-Added functions to take name inputs from .txt files. Ultimately, the raw values that
help create the random name are now more efficient and straightforward to use.
-Removed createMiddleName method
